# Robotic Musicianship at Georgia Tech

## About
This is a repository for Motion Capture and Music MIDI Generation which is part of Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology's **Forest** project.

## Fall 2021

### Results

Robots come alive to music, interacting and playing with live musicians. The robots listen and respond to melody, rhythm and harmony of the performers and sing/dance along with them. The tech involves real-time pitch and beat detection that trigger different movements and sounds.
